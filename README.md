PatchMyPath is a free and open source Windows application for managing multiple Grand Theft Auto San Andreas/IV/V and Red Dead Redemption 2 installations. It allows you to quickly switch between them, so you can have separate folders for playing the online modes and single player with mods. PatchMyPath is compatible with all game versions and stores (Rockstar Warehouse, Rockstar Games Launcher, Steam and Epic Games Launcher).

Please note that PatchMyPath does not supports pirate copies of Grand Theft Auto IV/V and Red Dead Redemption 2.

Bugsnag is used for error reporting and monitoring. This can be disabled on the program options.
