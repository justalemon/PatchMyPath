# PatchMyPath [![AppVeyor][appveyor-img]][appveyor-url] [![CodeFactor][codefactor-img]][codefactor-url] [![Discord][discord-img]][discord-url]

PatchMyPath is a free and open source Windows application for managing multiple Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2 installations. It allows you to quickly switch between them, so you can have separate folders for playing GTA Online/Red Dead Online and single player with mods. PatchMyPath is compatible with all game versions and stores (Rockstar Warehouse, Rockstar Games Launcher, Steam and Epic Games Launcher). You can even use external tools like [alloc8or's](https://www.gta5-mods.com/users/alloc8or) [Launcher Bypass](https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/gtavlauncherbypass) or hooks like [Dot's](https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/users/76034948) [RedHook2](https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/53)!

Please note that PatchMyPath does not supports pirate copies of Red Dead Redemption 2 and Grand Theft Auto V.
