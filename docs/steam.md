# Using Steam with PatchMyPath

PatchMyPath provides the option to use Steam to launch the following install types:

* Grand Theft Auto V - Vanilla Steam
* Grand Theft Auto V - Vanilla Non Steam
* Red Dead Redemption 2 - Vanilla Non Steam
* Red Dead Redemption 2 - RedHook2

If you purchased Grand Theft Auto V on Steam, you only need to enable the respective option on the `Settings` tab and PatchMyPath is ready to go.

For Red Dead Redemption 2 or Grand Theft Auto V in the Rockstar Games Launcher or Epic Games Launcher, you need to add it as a Non Steam Game and add the custom App ID in the settings. To get the App ID for a non-Steam game, you need to:

1. Create a shortcut by Right Clicking the game and going to `Manage > Add desktop shortcut`
    ![Create Steam Shortcut](../images/create-shortcut.png)
2. Right click the game shortcut on your desktop and select `Properties`
3. On the `URL` field, copy the set of numbers at the end
    ![Desktop Shortcut](../images/shortcut.png)
4. Paste those numbers into the respective game field in the PatchMyPath Settings and press `Save`
